                    <Pre>**Rakesh Sharma** is a retired Indian Air Force pilot and astronaut,
    known for being the first Indian to travel to space. 
    Born on **January 13, 1949**, in Patiala, Punjab, he was selected for the 
    **Intercosmos program**, a Soviet initiative to involve cosmonauts from 
    allied countries in space missions. On **April 2, 1984**, Sharma flew 
    aboard the **Soyuz T-11** spacecraft, where he spent nearly **8 days**
    aboard the Salyut 7 space station. During his mission, he conducted 
    scientific and technical experiments and became a national hero in India.
    One of his most famous quotes came when he was asked by then-Prime 
    Minister **Indira Gandhi** how India looked from space; he replied,
    "Saare jahan se achha," meaning it looked better than the entire world.
    After his spaceflight, Rakesh Sharma returned to India and continued to
    serve in the Indian Air Force before retiring. He has received numerous
    awards for his contributions to space exploration, including the 
    **Ashoka Chakra**, India's highest peacetime military honor.   </Pre>

                 <Pre>**Kalpana Chawla** was an Indian-American astronaut and aerospace engineer,
    born on **March 17, 1962**, in Karnal, Haryana, India. She became the first
    woman of Indian origin to go to space, flying on her first mission, **STS-87**
    aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in **1997**. During this mission, she conducted
     various scientific experiments and spent approximately **376 hours** in space.
    Chawla later flew on her second mission, **STS-107**, in **2003**. Tragically,
    this mission ended in disaster when the Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry,
     resulting in the loss of all seven crew members, including Chawla. 
     Kalpana Chawla is remembered as a pioneering figure in space exploration,
      inspiring countless individuals, especially women, to pursue careers in
       science and engineering. Her legacy continues to resonate, symbolizing 
       courage and determination in the pursuit of knowledge and exploration.

                <div class="tittle3"> Neil Armstrong</div>
                 <Pre> **Neil Armstrong** was an American astronaut, aerospace engineer,
    and naval aviator, best known for being the first person to walk on the Moon.
     Born on **August 5, 1930**, in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong developed a
    passion for flying at a young age and earned his pilot's license before he
    even had a driver's license. He joined NASA in the early 1960s and flew on
    two space missions: **Gemini 8** in 1966 and **Apollo 11** in 1969.
     During the historic Apollo 11 mission, on **July 20, 1969**, Armstrong 
    became the first human to set foot on the lunar surface. He famously declared,
    "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," as he stepped
     onto the Moon. After his spaceflight career, Armstrong taught aerospace 
     engineering at the University of Cincinnati and remained active in promoting
    space exploration. He passed away on **August 25, 2012**, but his legacy 
    as a pioneer of human spaceflight continues to inspire generations around the
     world.

                 <Pre>   The first animal to go to space was **Laika**, a Soviet space dog.
    Laika was launched aboard **Sputnik 2** on **November 3, 1957**, 
    just a month after the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. 
    Laika's mission was significant as it provided scientists with 
    the first data on the biological effects of space travel on a living organism.
     Unfortunately, Laika did not survive the mission, as there were no means to
     bring her back to Earth at that time. The mission highlighted the challengesof 
     space travel and led to important advancements in human spaceflight safety in
      subsequent years.
